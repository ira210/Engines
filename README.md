A mod for endless sky which masivly reballances engines 
Currently only appling to human space and very much in alpha this reduces drag on all ships to 1, will make engine thrust, turn, energy and heat
scale linearly and add a system to limit the number of engines installed on a given ship. Please send feedback to ira.210github@gmail.com
